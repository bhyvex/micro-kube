# micro-kube

**micro-kube** is the fastest way to start a fully-functional, single-node
[Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) cluster using [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) on
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

micro-kube attempts to differentiate itself from other similar projects by being maximally useful
right out-of-the-box.  See the [roadmap](#roadmap) for further details.

## Getting started

Getting started with micro-kube on a Mac or Linux machine is incredibly easy as long as you have
Vagrant already installed and functioning properly.

Just clone this repository and `vagrant up`!

```
$ git clone git@github.com:krancour/micro-kube.git
$ cd micro-kube
$ vagrant up
```

Allow a couple minutes after starting for all services to become fully function.  Wait time may
vary with the speed of your internet connection.

The Kubernetes API will be available at http://172.17.8.100:8080 and https://172.17.8.100:6443

The Kubernetes UI (a dashboard application) will be available at
http://kube-ui.kube-system.micro-kube.io

## Installing kubectl

If this is your first time exploring Kubernetes and you don't already have the __kubectl__ tool
installed, follow the installation directions
[here](http://kubernetes.io/v1.0/docs/getting-started-guides/aws/kubectl.html).

## Configuring kubectl

micro-kube exposes both secure and insecure API endpoints.  As such, either of the following
configurations will adequately prepare your kubectl tool to interact with micro-kube.

__Insecure:__

From the micro-kube directory:

```
$ kubectl config set-cluster micro-kube-insecure --server=http://172.17.8.100:8080
$ kubectl config set-context micro-kube-insecure --cluster=micro-kube-insecure
$ kubectl config use-context micro-kube-insecure
```

__Secure:__

From the micro-kube directory:

```
$ kubectl config set-cluster micro-kube-secure --server=https://172.17.8.100:6443 --certificate-authority=$(pwd)/ssl/ca.pem
$ kubectl config set-credentials micro-kube-admin --client-certificate=$(pwd)/ssl/admin.pem --client-key=$(pwd)/ssl/admin-key.pem
$ kubectl config set-context micro-kube-secure --cluster=micro-kube-secure --user=micro-kube-admin
$ kubectl config use-context micro-kube-secure
```

## Configuration options

micro-kube does not expose many configuration options.  The few available can be tweaked by
providing a `config.rb` file.

micro-kube comes with sample configuration which also contains documentation for each option.  You
can create your own `config.rb` by copying and modifying this sample.

From the micro-kube directory:

```
$ cp config.rb.sample config.rb
```

## How it works

micro-kube's `Vagrantfile` uses cloud-config found in the file `user-data`.  This includes various
scripts and systemd units required to download and start just one binary:

* kubelet

A kubelet is a Kubernetes agent that typically runs on every node-- of course micro-kube has just
one node.  It is able to start pods and their constituent containers at the behest of the
scheduler, but it can _also_ be configured to start pods whose manifests are stored locally on
disk.  micro-kube uses that strategy to compel the kubelet to launch the rest of the Kubernetes
components in pods within a `kube-system` namespace.  These include:

* kube-apiserver
* kube-controller-manager
* kube-scheduler
* kube-proxy

micro-kube also starts two Kubernetes add-ons by using the kubectl tool directly to create
requisite replication controllers and services _after_ the containerized kube-apiserver becomes
available.  These add-ons include:

* [kube-ui](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-ui)
* [kube-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster/addons/dns)

## Troubleshooting

Although this should be a rare event, if micro-kube should happen to not function as expected, one
can begin to troubleshoot by checking the status of various Kubernetes components and inspecting
their logs.

### Troubleshooting the kubelet

The kubelet is the one kubernetes component that is started from a binary.  To check its status,
one must first ssh to the micro-kube VM.

From the micro-kube directory:

```
$ vagrant ssh
```

To check status:

```
$ sudo systemctl status kubelet
```

To view logs:

```
$ sudo journalctl -fu kubelet
```

### Troubleshooting other components

In micro-kube, all other components _of_ Kubernetes are managed _by_ Kubernetes.  To list the pods
that comprise the `kube-system` namespace:

```
$ kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system
```

You can view logs for any pod in the `kube-system` namespace like so:

```
$ kubectl logs <pod name> --namespace=kube-system
```

## <a name="roadmap"></a>Known issues and roadmap

* Kubernetes services are exposed using virtual IPs that are meaningless outside of the Kubernetes
  cluster.  (In micro-kube's case, meaningless outside of the Vagrant VM).  In the case of
  services exposing port 80 for HTTP traffic, the micro-kube-router component (which uses Nginx)
  dynamically reflects those services through virtual hosts on the VM's own port 80.  Currently,
  services running on other ports or using other protocols are not reflected.  This is presently
  micro-kube's most damning limitation.  We plan to address this in an upcoming release by
  improving the micro-kube-router component to route traffic for all ports and protocols.

* Although micro-kube exposes both secure and insecure API endpoints, the kube-ui addon is
  accessible _only_ an insecure port.

Pull requests that make micro-kube more awesome are welcome!  The primary guideline for
contribution is to keep things simple so micro-kube remains lightweight and easy-to-use.
